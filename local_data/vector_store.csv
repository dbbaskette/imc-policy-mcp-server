"02cdb699-90f7-4c57-9937-096f98081354","If a premium is shown on the Policy Declarations for Automobile Liability Insurance, we 
will pay damages which an insured person is legally obligated to pay because of: 1. 
bodily injury sustained by any person, and 2. damage to, or destruction of, property. 
Under these coverages, your policy protects an insured person from liability for 
damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use, loading or unloading, of 
an insured auto. We will not pay any punitive or exemplary damages, fines or penalties 
under this coverage. We will defend an insured person sued as a result of a covered 
accident. We will choose the counsel. We may settle any claim or suit if we believe it is 
proper.

Additional Payments We Will Make

When we defend an insured person under this Part, we will pay:

1.​ Up to $100 a day for the loss of wages or salary if we ask that person to attend 
hearings or trials.

2.​ Court costs for defense. 
3.​ Interest accruing on a judgment entered against you, but only on that part of a

judgment which does not exceed our limits of liability. 
4.​ Premiums on appeal bonds and on bonds to release attachments, but not in

excess of our limit of liability. 
5.​ The cost of any bail bonds required because of an accident, not to exceed

$300 per bond.

Exclusions - What Is Not Covered Under Liability

We will not pay for any damages an insured person is legally obligated to pay because 
of:

●​ Intentional Injury: Bodily injury or property damage intended by, or reasonably 
expected to result from, the intentional or criminal acts or omissions of an

BILLING & CANCELLATION TERMS

Payment:

If your initial premium payment for your first policy period is by check, draft, or any 
remittance other than cash, such payment is conditional upon the check, draft, or 
remittance being honored upon presentation. If such check, draft, or remittance is not 
honored, this policy shall be deemed void from its inception.

Conditional Reinstatement:

If we send a cancellation notice because the required premium was not paid in a 
timely manner, and you then tender payment by a remittance which is not honored

upon presentation, your policy will terminate on the date and time shown on the 
cancellation notice and any notice we issue which waives the cancellation or 
reinstates coverage is void.

Transfer:

You may not transfer this policy to another person without our written consent. 
However, if you die, this policy will provide coverage until the end of the policy period 
for your legal representative while acting as such and for persons covered on the date 
of your death.

"09621fd8-8806-4dae-aa27-7cd5c2825649","A person making a claim must allow us to take signed and recorded statements, 
including sworn statements and examinations under oath, separately and apart from 
others, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may 
reasonably require.

Our Payment Of Loss:

Our limit of liability is the least of: 1) the actual cash value of the property or damaged 
part of the property at the time of loss, which may include a deduction for 
depreciation; 2) the cost to repair or replace the property or part to its physical 
condition at the time of loss using parts produced by or for the vehicle's 
manufacturer, or parts from other sources; or 3) the limit of liability shown on the 
Policy Declarations. Any applicable deductible amount is then subtracted.

Right To Appraisal:

Both you and we have a right to demand an appraisal of the loss. Each will appoint 
and pay a qualified appraiser. The two appraisers, or a judge of a court of record, will 
select an umpire. A written agreement by any two of these three persons will 
determine the amount of the loss.

Action Against Us:

No one may bring an action against us in any way related to the existence or amount 
of coverage, or the amount of loss for which coverage is sought, unless there is full 
compliance with all policy terms and such action is commenced within two years after 
the date of the accident.

No Benefit To Bailee:

This insurance will not benefit any person or organization who may be caring for or 
handling your property for a fee.

"0a6269bf-291b-4da6-9f3d-82223333945e","A person making a claim must allow us to take signed and recorded statements, 
including sworn statements and examinations under oath, separately and apart from 
others, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may 
reasonably require.

Our Payment Of Loss:

Our limit of liability is the least of: 1) the actual cash value of the property or damaged 
part of the property at the time of loss, which may include a deduction for 
depreciation; 2) the cost to repair or replace the property or part to its physical 
condition at the time of loss using parts produced by or for the vehicle's 
manufacturer, or parts from other sources; or 3) the limit of liability shown on the 
Policy Declarations. Any applicable deductible amount is then subtracted.

Right To Appraisal:

Both you and we have a right to demand an appraisal of the loss. Each will appoint 
and pay a qualified appraiser. The two appraisers, or a judge of a court of record, will 
select an umpire. A written agreement by any two of these three persons will 
determine the amount of the loss.

Action Against Us:

No one may bring an action against us in any way related to the existence or amount 
of coverage, or the amount of loss for which coverage is sought, unless there is full 
compliance with all policy terms and such action is commenced within two years after 
the date of the accident.

No Benefit To Bailee:

This insurance will not benefit any person or organization who may be caring for or 
handling your property for a fee.

"102a92c2-c3fc-467d-b072-eeede198da64","A person making a claim must allow us to take signed and recorded statements, 
including sworn statements and examinations under oath, separately and apart from 
others, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may 
reasonably require.

Our Payment Of Loss:

Our limit of liability is the least of: 1) the actual cash value of the property or damaged 
part of the property at the time of loss, which may include a deduction for 
depreciation; 2) the cost to repair or replace the property or part to its physical 
condition at the time of loss using parts produced by or for the vehicle's 
manufacturer, or parts from other sources; or 3) the limit of liability shown on the 
Policy Declarations. Any applicable deductible amount is then subtracted.

Right To Appraisal:

Both you and we have a right to demand an appraisal of the loss. Each will appoint 
and pay a qualified appraiser. The two appraisers, or a judge of a court of record, will 
select an umpire. A written agreement by any two of these three persons will 
determine the amount of the loss.

Action Against Us:

No one may bring an action against us in any way related to the existence or amount 
of coverage, or the amount of loss for which coverage is sought, unless there is full 
compliance with all policy terms and such action is commenced within two years after 
the date of the accident.

No Benefit To Bailee:

This insurance will not benefit any person or organization who may be caring for or 
handling your property for a fee.

"11caf46b-a1c5-47ef-8ed2-08cc418ac45a","If a premium is shown on the Policy Declarations for Automobile Liability Insurance, we 
will pay damages which an insured person is legally obligated to pay because of: 1. 
bodily injury sustained by any person, and 2. damage to, or destruction of, property. 
Under these coverages, your policy protects an insured person from liability for 
damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use, loading or unloading, of 
an insured auto. We will not pay any punitive or exemplary damages, fines or penalties 
under this coverage. We will defend an insured person sued as a result of a covered 
accident. We will choose the counsel. We may settle any claim or suit if we believe it is 
proper.

Additional Payments We Will Make

When we defend an insured person under this Part, we will pay:

1.​ Up to $100 a day for the loss of wages or salary if we ask that person to attend 
hearings or trials.

2.​ Court costs for defense. 
3.​ Interest accruing on a judgment entered against you, but only on that part of a

judgment which does not exceed our limits of liability. 
4.​ Premiums on appeal bonds and on bonds to release attachments, but not in

excess of our limit of liability. 
5.​ The cost of any bail bonds required because of an accident, not to exceed

$300 per bond.

Exclusions - What Is Not Covered Under Liability

We will not pay for any damages an insured person is legally obligated to pay because 
of:

●​ Intentional Injury: Bodily injury or property damage intended by, or reasonably 
expected to result from, the intentional or criminal acts or omissions of an

If a premium is shown on the Policy Declarations for Automobile Medical Payments,

we will pay to or on behalf of an insured person reasonable expenses actually incurred 
for necessary medical treatment, medical services or medical products. Payment will 
be made only when bodily injury is caused by a motor vehicle accident. Medical 
treatment must begin within 90 days of the date of the accident and be rendered

-----Part 2: General Provisions & Insuring Agreement

Insuring Agreement

This policy is a legal contract between you (the policyholder listed as Named Insured on the 
Policy Declarations) and us (Insurance Megacorp). A coverage applies only when a premium for 
it is shown on the Policy Declarations. If you pay the premiums when due and comply with the 
policy terms, we, relying on the information you have given us, agree to provide the coverages 
as described herein. You agree that it is your responsibility to review your Policy Declarations to 
confirm that the coverages and limits that you requested have actually been issued to you and 
are appropriate for your insurance needs. The terms of this policy impose joint obligations on 
persons defined as insured persons. This means that the responsibilities, acts and omissions of 
a person defined as an insured person will be binding upon other person(s) defined as insured 
person(s).

When And Where The Policy Applies

Your policy applies only during the policy period. During this time, it applies to covered losses to 
the auto, accidents, and occurrences within the United States, its territories or possessions, 
Canada, and between their ports.

Conformity To State Statutes

When the policy provisions are in conflict with the statutes of the state in which your auto(s) 
described on the Policy Declarations are principally garaged, the provisions are amended to

"1803a537-d585-423f-9f22-7bd4ff0733ca","A person making a claim must allow us to take signed and recorded statements, 
including sworn statements and examinations under oath, separately and apart from 
others, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may 
reasonably require.

Our Payment Of Loss:

Our limit of liability is the least of: 1) the actual cash value of the property or damaged 
part of the property at the time of loss, which may include a deduction for 
depreciation; 2) the cost to repair or replace the property or part to its physical 
condition at the time of loss using parts produced by or for the vehicle's 
manufacturer, or parts from other sources; or 3) the limit of liability shown on the 
Policy Declarations. Any applicable deductible amount is then subtracted.

Right To Appraisal:

Both you and we have a right to demand an appraisal of the loss. Each will appoint 
and pay a qualified appraiser. The two appraisers, or a judge of a court of record, will 
select an umpire. A written agreement by any two of these three persons will 
determine the amount of the loss.

Action Against Us:

No one may bring an action against us in any way related to the existence or amount 
of coverage, or the amount of loss for which coverage is sought, unless there is full 
compliance with all policy terms and such action is commenced within two years after 
the date of the accident.

No Benefit To Bailee:

This insurance will not benefit any person or organization who may be caring for or 
handling your property for a fee.

for necessary medical treatment, medical services or medical products. Payment will 
be made only when bodily injury is caused by a motor vehicle accident. Medical 
treatment must begin within 90 days of the date of the accident and be rendered

BILLING & CANCELLATION TERMS

Payment:

If your initial premium payment for your first policy period is by check, draft, or any 
remittance other than cash, such payment is conditional upon the check, draft, or 
remittance being honored upon presentation. If such check, draft, or remittance is not

honored, this policy shall be deemed void from its inception.

Conditional Reinstatement:

If we send a cancellation notice because the required premium was not paid in a 
timely manner, and you then tender payment by a remittance which is not honored 
upon presentation, your policy will terminate on the date and time shown on the 
cancellation notice and any notice we issue which waives the cancellation or 
reinstates coverage is void.

Transfer:

You may not transfer this policy to another person without our written consent. 
However, if you die, this policy will provide coverage until the end of the policy period 
for your legal representative while acting as such and for persons covered on the date 
of your death.

-----Part 2: General Provisions & Insuring Agreement

Insuring Agreement

This policy is a legal contract between you (the policyholder listed as Named Insured on the 
Policy Declarations) and us (Insurance Megacorp). A coverage applies only when a premium for 
it is shown on the Policy Declarations. If you pay the premiums when due and comply with the 
policy terms, we, relying on the information you have given us, agree to provide the coverages 
as described herein. You agree that it is your responsibility to review your Policy Declarations to 
confirm that the coverages and limits that you requested have actually been issued to you and 
are appropriate for your insurance needs. The terms of this policy impose joint obligations on 
persons defined as insured persons. This means that the responsibilities, acts and omissions of 
a person defined as an insured person will be binding upon other person(s) defined as insured 
person(s).

When And Where The Policy Applies

Your policy applies only during the policy period. During this time, it applies to covered losses to 
the auto, accidents, and occurrences within the United States, its territories or possessions, 
Canada, and between their ports.

Conformity To State Statutes

When the policy provisions are in conflict with the statutes of the state in which your auto(s) 
described on the Policy Declarations are principally garaged, the provisions are amended to

BILLING & CANCELLATION TERMS

Payment:

If your initial premium payment for your first policy period is by check, draft, or any 
remittance other than cash, such payment is conditional upon the check, draft, or 
remittance being honored upon presentation. If such check, draft, or remittance is not 
honored, this policy shall be deemed void from its inception.

Conditional Reinstatement:

If we send a cancellation notice because the required premium was not paid in a 
timely manner, and you then tender payment by a remittance which is not honored

upon presentation, your policy will terminate on the date and time shown on the 
cancellation notice and any notice we issue which waives the cancellation or 
reinstates coverage is void.

Transfer:

You may not transfer this policy to another person without our written consent. 
However, if you die, this policy will provide coverage until the end of the policy period 
for your legal representative while acting as such and for persons covered on the date 
of your death.

BILLING & CANCELLATION TERMS

Payment:

If your initial premium payment for your first policy period is by check, draft, or any 
remittance other than cash, such payment is conditional upon the check, draft, or 
remittance being honored upon presentation. If such check, draft, or remittance is not 
honored, this policy shall be deemed void from its inception.

Conditional Reinstatement:

If we send a cancellation notice because the required premium was not paid in a 
timely manner, and you then tender payment by a remittance which is not honored 
upon presentation, your policy will terminate on the date and time shown on the 
cancellation notice and any notice we issue which waives the cancellation or 
reinstates coverage is void.

Transfer:

You may not transfer this policy to another person without our written consent. 
However, if you die, this policy will provide coverage until the end of the policy period 
for your legal representative while acting as such and for persons covered on the date 
of your death.

"312287b4-e430-485c-8863-d32d03eb16db","A person making a claim must allow us to take signed and recorded statements, 
including sworn statements and examinations under oath, separately and apart from 
others, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may 
reasonably require.

Our Payment Of Loss:

Our limit of liability is the least of: 1) the actual cash value of the property or damaged 
part of the property at the time of loss, which may include a deduction for 
depreciation; 2) the cost to repair or replace the property or part to its physical 
condition at the time of loss using parts produced by or for the vehicle's 
manufacturer, or parts from other sources; or 3) the limit of liability shown on the 
Policy Declarations. Any applicable deductible amount is then subtracted.

Right To Appraisal:

Both you and we have a right to demand an appraisal of the loss. Each will appoint 
and pay a qualified appraiser. The two appraisers, or a judge of a court of record, will 
select an umpire. A written agreement by any two of these three persons will 
determine the amount of the loss.

Action Against Us:

No one may bring an action against us in any way related to the existence or amount 
of coverage, or the amount of loss for which coverage is sought, unless there is full 
compliance with all policy terms and such action is commenced within two years after 
the date of the accident.

No Benefit To Bailee:

This insurance will not benefit any person or organization who may be caring for or 
handling your property for a fee.

"352867ab-15f1-466d-be59-0def742cb3ad","A person making a claim must allow us to take signed and recorded statements, 
including sworn statements and examinations under oath, separately and apart from 
others, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may 
reasonably require.

Our Payment Of Loss:

Our limit of liability is the least of: 1) the actual cash value of the property or damaged 
part of the property at the time of loss, which may include a deduction for 
depreciation; 2) the cost to repair or replace the property or part to its physical 
condition at the time of loss using parts produced by or for the vehicle's 
manufacturer, or parts from other sources; or 3) the limit of liability shown on the 
Policy Declarations. Any applicable deductible amount is then subtracted.

Right To Appraisal:

Both you and we have a right to demand an appraisal of the loss. Each will appoint 
and pay a qualified appraiser. The two appraisers, or a judge of a court of record, will 
select an umpire. A written agreement by any two of these three persons will 
determine the amount of the loss.

Action Against Us:

No one may bring an action against us in any way related to the existence or amount 
of coverage, or the amount of loss for which coverage is sought, unless there is full 
compliance with all policy terms and such action is commenced within two years after 
the date of the accident.

No Benefit To Bailee:

This insurance will not benefit any person or organization who may be caring for or 
handling your property for a fee.

-----Part 2: General Provisions & Insuring Agreement

Insuring Agreement

This policy is a legal contract between you (the policyholder listed as Named Insured on the 
Policy Declarations) and us (Insurance Megacorp). A coverage applies only when a premium for 
it is shown on the Policy Declarations. If you pay the premiums when due and comply with the 
policy terms, we, relying on the information you have given us, agree to provide the coverages 
as described herein. You agree that it is your responsibility to review your Policy Declarations to 
confirm that the coverages and limits that you requested have actually been issued to you and 
are appropriate for your insurance needs. The terms of this policy impose joint obligations on 
persons defined as insured persons. This means that the responsibilities, acts and omissions of 
a person defined as an insured person will be binding upon other person(s) defined as insured 
person(s).

When And Where The Policy Applies

Your policy applies only during the policy period. During this time, it applies to covered losses to 
the auto, accidents, and occurrences within the United States, its territories or possessions, 
Canada, and between their ports.

Conformity To State Statutes

When the policy provisions are in conflict with the statutes of the state in which your auto(s) 
described on the Policy Declarations are principally garaged, the provisions are amended to

"3feee1fc-a2b7-4d29-afac-101a463ee22e","If a premium is shown on the Policy Declarations for Automobile Liability Insurance, we 
will pay damages which an insured person is legally obligated to pay because of: 1. 
bodily injury sustained by any person, and 2. damage to, or destruction of, property. 
Under these coverages, your policy protects an insured person from liability for 
damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use, loading or unloading, of 
an insured auto. We will not pay any punitive or exemplary damages, fines or penalties 
under this coverage. We will defend an insured person sued as a result of a covered 
accident. We will choose the counsel. We may settle any claim or suit if we believe it is 
proper.

Additional Payments We Will Make

When we defend an insured person under this Part, we will pay:

1.​ Up to $100 a day for the loss of wages or salary if we ask that person to attend 
hearings or trials.

2.​ Court costs for defense. 
3.​ Interest accruing on a judgment entered against you, but only on that part of a

judgment which does not exceed our limits of liability. 
4.​ Premiums on appeal bonds and on bonds to release attachments, but not in

excess of our limit of liability. 
5.​ The cost of any bail bonds required because of an accident, not to exceed

$300 per bond.

Exclusions - What Is Not Covered Under Liability

We will not pay for any damages an insured person is legally obligated to pay because 
of:

●​ Intentional Injury: Bodily injury or property damage intended by, or reasonably 
expected to result from, the intentional or criminal acts or omissions of an

BILLING & CANCELLATION TERMS

Payment:

If your initial premium payment for your first policy period is by check, draft, or any 
remittance other than cash, such payment is conditional upon the check, draft, or 
remittance being honored upon presentation. If such check, draft, or remittance is not 
honored, this policy shall be deemed void from its inception.

Conditional Reinstatement:

If we send a cancellation notice because the required premium was not paid in a 
timely manner, and you then tender payment by a remittance which is not honored

upon presentation, your policy will terminate on the date and time shown on the 
cancellation notice and any notice we issue which waives the cancellation or 
reinstates coverage is void.

Transfer:

You may not transfer this policy to another person without our written consent. 
However, if you die, this policy will provide coverage until the end of the policy period 
for your legal representative while acting as such and for persons covered on the date 
of your death.

BILLING & CANCELLATION TERMS

Payment:

If your initial premium payment for your first policy period is by check, draft, or any 
remittance other than cash, such payment is conditional upon the check, draft, or 
remittance being honored upon presentation. If such check, draft, or remittance is not

honored, this policy shall be deemed void from its inception.

Conditional Reinstatement:

If we send a cancellation notice because the required premium was not paid in a 
timely manner, and you then tender payment by a remittance which is not honored 
upon presentation, your policy will terminate on the date and time shown on the 
cancellation notice and any notice we issue which waives the cancellation or 
reinstates coverage is void.

Transfer:

You may not transfer this policy to another person without our written consent. 
However, if you die, this policy will provide coverage until the end of the policy period 
for your legal representative while acting as such and for persons covered on the date 
of your death.

BILLING & CANCELLATION TERMS

Payment:

If your initial premium payment for your first policy period is by check, draft, or any 
remittance other than cash, such payment is conditional upon the check, draft, or 
remittance being honored upon presentation. If such check, draft, or remittance is not

honored, this policy shall be deemed void from its inception.

Conditional Reinstatement:

If we send a cancellation notice because the required premium was not paid in a 
timely manner, and you then tender payment by a remittance which is not honored 
upon presentation, your policy will terminate on the date and time shown on the 
cancellation notice and any notice we issue which waives the cancellation or 
reinstates coverage is void.

Transfer:

You may not transfer this policy to another person without our written consent. 
However, if you die, this policy will provide coverage until the end of the policy period 
for your legal representative while acting as such and for persons covered on the date 
of your death.

"506b8cdf-b4d8-469f-814c-5a516bad1e7f","A person making a claim must allow us to take signed and recorded statements, 
including sworn statements and examinations under oath, separately and apart from 
others, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may 
reasonably require.

Our Payment Of Loss:

Our limit of liability is the least of: 1) the actual cash value of the property or damaged 
part of the property at the time of loss, which may include a deduction for 
depreciation; 2) the cost to repair or replace the property or part to its physical 
condition at the time of loss using parts produced by or for the vehicle's 
manufacturer, or parts from other sources; or 3) the limit of liability shown on the 
Policy Declarations. Any applicable deductible amount is then subtracted.

Right To Appraisal:

Both you and we have a right to demand an appraisal of the loss. Each will appoint 
and pay a qualified appraiser. The two appraisers, or a judge of a court of record, will 
select an umpire. A written agreement by any two of these three persons will 
determine the amount of the loss.

Action Against Us:

No one may bring an action against us in any way related to the existence or amount 
of coverage, or the amount of loss for which coverage is sought, unless there is full 
compliance with all policy terms and such action is commenced within two years after 
the date of the accident.

No Benefit To Bailee:

This insurance will not benefit any person or organization who may be caring for or 
handling your property for a fee.

"6009e57e-2b02-472f-87f0-9ff88c1aa1e3","A person making a claim must allow us to take signed and recorded statements, 
including sworn statements and examinations under oath, separately and apart from 
others, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may 
reasonably require.

Our Payment Of Loss:

Our limit of liability is the least of: 1) the actual cash value of the property or damaged 
part of the property at the time of loss, which may include a deduction for 
depreciation; 2) the cost to repair or replace the property or part to its physical 
condition at the time of loss using parts produced by or for the vehicle's 
manufacturer, or parts from other sources; or 3) the limit of liability shown on the 
Policy Declarations. Any applicable deductible amount is then subtracted.

Right To Appraisal:

Both you and we have a right to demand an appraisal of the loss. Each will appoint 
and pay a qualified appraiser. The two appraisers, or a judge of a court of record, will 
select an umpire. A written agreement by any two of these three persons will 
determine the amount of the loss.

Action Against Us:

No one may bring an action against us in any way related to the existence or amount 
of coverage, or the amount of loss for which coverage is sought, unless there is full 
compliance with all policy terms and such action is commenced within two years after 
the date of the accident.

No Benefit To Bailee:

This insurance will not benefit any person or organization who may be caring for or 
handling your property for a fee.

If a premium is shown on the Policy Declarations for Automobile Medical Payments,

we will pay to or on behalf of an insured person reasonable expenses actually incurred 
for necessary medical treatment, medical services or medical products. Payment will 
be made only when bodily injury is caused by a motor vehicle accident. Medical 
treatment must begin within 90 days of the date of the accident and be rendered

General Statement Of Coverage

If a premium is shown on the Policy Declarations for Automobile Liability Insurance, we will pay 
damages which an insured person is legally obligated to pay because of: 1. bodily injury 
sustained by any person, and 2. damage to, or destruction of, property. Under these coverages, 
your policy protects an insured person from liability for damages arising out of the ownership, 
maintenance, or use, loading or unloading, of an insured auto. We will not pay any punitive or 
exemplary damages, fines or penalties under this coverage. We will defend an insured person 
sued as a result of a covered accident. We will choose the counsel. We may settle any claim or 
suit if we believe it is proper.

Additional Payments We Will Make

When we defend an insured person under this Part, we will pay:

1.​ Up to $100 a day for the loss of wages or salary if we ask that person to attend hearings 
or trials.

2.​ Court costs for defense. 
3.​ Interest accruing on a judgment entered against you, but only on that part of a judgment

which does not exceed our limits of liability. 
4.​ Premiums on appeal bonds and on bonds to release attachments, but not in excess of

our limit of liability. 
5.​ The cost of any bail bonds required because of an accident, not to exceed $300 per

bond.

"65177d29-b564-4ef4-9af2-1bee20a42e12","A person making a claim must allow us to take signed and recorded statements, 
including sworn statements and examinations under oath, separately and apart from 
others, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may 
reasonably require.

Our Payment Of Loss:

Our limit of liability is the least of: 1) the actual cash value of the property or damaged 
part of the property at the time of loss, which may include a deduction for 
depreciation; 2) the cost to repair or replace the property or part to its physical 
condition at the time of loss using parts produced by or for the vehicle's 
manufacturer, or parts from other sources; or 3) the limit of liability shown on the 
Policy Declarations. Any applicable deductible amount is then subtracted.

Right To Appraisal:

Both you and we have a right to demand an appraisal of the loss. Each will appoint 
and pay a qualified appraiser. The two appraisers, or a judge of a court of record, will 
select an umpire. A written agreement by any two of these three persons will 
determine the amount of the loss.

Action Against Us:

No one may bring an action against us in any way related to the existence or amount 
of coverage, or the amount of loss for which coverage is sought, unless there is full 
compliance with all policy terms and such action is commenced within two years after 
the date of the accident.

No Benefit To Bailee:

This insurance will not benefit any person or organization who may be caring for or 
handling your property for a fee.

-----Part 2: General Provisions & Insuring Agreement

Insuring Agreement

This policy is a legal contract between you (the policyholder listed as Named Insured on the 
Policy Declarations) and us (Insurance Megacorp). A coverage applies only when a premium for 
it is shown on the Policy Declarations. If you pay the premiums when due and comply with the 
policy terms, we, relying on the information you have given us, agree to provide the coverages 
as described herein. You agree that it is your responsibility to review your Policy Declarations to 
confirm that the coverages and limits that you requested have actually been issued to you and 
are appropriate for your insurance needs. The terms of this policy impose joint obligations on 
persons defined as insured persons. This means that the responsibilities, acts and omissions of 
a person defined as an insured person will be binding upon other person(s) defined as insured 
person(s).

When And Where The Policy Applies

Your policy applies only during the policy period. During this time, it applies to covered losses to 
the auto, accidents, and occurrences within the United States, its territories or possessions, 
Canada, and between their ports.

Conformity To State Statutes

When the policy provisions are in conflict with the statutes of the state in which your auto(s) 
described on the Policy Declarations are principally garaged, the provisions are amended to

BILLING & CANCELLATION TERMS

Payment:

If your initial premium payment for your first policy period is by check, draft, or any 
remittance other than cash, such payment is conditional upon the check, draft, or 
remittance being honored upon presentation. If such check, draft, or remittance is not 
honored, this policy shall be deemed void from its inception.

Conditional Reinstatement:

If we send a cancellation notice because the required premium was not paid in a 
timely manner, and you then tender payment by a remittance which is not honored 
upon presentation, your policy will terminate on the date and time shown on the 
cancellation notice and any notice we issue which waives the cancellation or 
reinstates coverage is void.

Transfer:

You may not transfer this policy to another person without our written consent. 
However, if you die, this policy will provide coverage until the end of the policy period 
for your legal representative while acting as such and for persons covered on the date 
of your death.

"6f4736a0-7d30-429e-b4b8-b24ab72d8e88","A person making a claim must allow us to take signed and recorded statements, 
including sworn statements and examinations under oath, separately and apart from 
others, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may 
reasonably require.

Our Payment Of Loss:

Our limit of liability is the least of: 1) the actual cash value of the property or damaged 
part of the property at the time of loss, which may include a deduction for 
depreciation; 2) the cost to repair or replace the property or part to its physical 
condition at the time of loss using parts produced by or for the vehicle's 
manufacturer, or parts from other sources; or 3) the limit of liability shown on the 
Policy Declarations. Any applicable deductible amount is then subtracted.

Right To Appraisal:

Both you and we have a right to demand an appraisal of the loss. Each will appoint 
and pay a qualified appraiser. The two appraisers, or a judge of a court of record, will 
select an umpire. A written agreement by any two of these three persons will 
determine the amount of the loss.

Action Against Us:

No one may bring an action against us in any way related to the existence or amount 
of coverage, or the amount of loss for which coverage is sought, unless there is full 
compliance with all policy terms and such action is commenced within two years after 
the date of the accident.

No Benefit To Bailee:

This insurance will not benefit any person or organization who may be caring for or 
handling your property for a fee.

BILLING & CANCELLATION TERMS

Payment:

If your initial premium payment for your first policy period is by check, draft, or any 
remittance other than cash, such payment is conditional upon the check, draft, or 
remittance being honored upon presentation. If such check, draft, or remittance is not 
honored, this policy shall be deemed void from its inception.

Conditional Reinstatement:

If we send a cancellation notice because the required premium was not paid in a 
timely manner, and you then tender payment by a remittance which is not honored 
upon presentation, your policy will terminate on the date and time shown on the 
cancellation notice and any notice we issue which waives the cancellation or 
reinstates coverage is void.

Transfer:

You may not transfer this policy to another person without our written consent. 
However, if you die, this policy will provide coverage until the end of the policy period 
for your legal representative while acting as such and for persons covered on the date 
of your death.

for necessary medical treatment, medical services or medical products. Payment will 
be made only when bodily injury is caused by a motor vehicle accident. Medical 
treatment must begin within 90 days of the date of the accident and be rendered

BILLING & CANCELLATION TERMS

Payment:

If your initial premium payment for your first policy period is by check, draft, or any 
remittance other than cash, such payment is conditional upon the check, draft, or 
remittance being honored upon presentation. If such check, draft, or remittance is not

honored, this policy shall be deemed void from its inception.

Conditional Reinstatement:

If we send a cancellation notice because the required premium was not paid in a 
timely manner, and you then tender payment by a remittance which is not honored 
upon presentation, your policy will terminate on the date and time shown on the 
cancellation notice and any notice we issue which waives the cancellation or 
reinstates coverage is void.

Transfer:

You may not transfer this policy to another person without our written consent. 
However, if you die, this policy will provide coverage until the end of the policy period 
for your legal representative while acting as such and for persons covered on the date 
of your death.

"7c7e5d2f-dde5-4cb9-85fa-4d1ceb534bb8","A person making a claim must allow us to take signed and recorded statements, 
including sworn statements and examinations under oath, separately and apart from 
others, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may 
reasonably require.

Our Payment Of Loss:

Our limit of liability is the least of: 1) the actual cash value of the property or damaged 
part of the property at the time of loss, which may include a deduction for 
depreciation; 2) the cost to repair or replace the property or part to its physical 
condition at the time of loss using parts produced by or for the vehicle's 
manufacturer, or parts from other sources; or 3) the limit of liability shown on the 
Policy Declarations. Any applicable deductible amount is then subtracted.

Right To Appraisal:

Both you and we have a right to demand an appraisal of the loss. Each will appoint 
and pay a qualified appraiser. The two appraisers, or a judge of a court of record, will 
select an umpire. A written agreement by any two of these three persons will 
determine the amount of the loss.

Action Against Us:

No one may bring an action against us in any way related to the existence or amount 
of coverage, or the amount of loss for which coverage is sought, unless there is full 
compliance with all policy terms and such action is commenced within two years after 
the date of the accident.

No Benefit To Bailee:

This insurance will not benefit any person or organization who may be caring for or 
handling your property for a fee.

"85dad119-da1a-4989-8119-f2c8e069d8f3","A person making a claim must allow us to take signed and recorded statements, 
including sworn statements and examinations under oath, separately and apart from 
others, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may 
reasonably require.

Our Payment Of Loss:

Our limit of liability is the least of: 1) the actual cash value of the property or damaged 
part of the property at the time of loss, which may include a deduction for 
depreciation; 2) the cost to repair or replace the property or part to its physical 
condition at the time of loss using parts produced by or for the vehicle's 
manufacturer, or parts from other sources; or 3) the limit of liability shown on the 
Policy Declarations. Any applicable deductible amount is then subtracted.

Right To Appraisal:

Both you and we have a right to demand an appraisal of the loss. Each will appoint 
and pay a qualified appraiser. The two appraisers, or a judge of a court of record, will 
select an umpire. A written agreement by any two of these three persons will 
determine the amount of the loss.

Action Against Us:

No one may bring an action against us in any way related to the existence or amount 
of coverage, or the amount of loss for which coverage is sought, unless there is full 
compliance with all policy terms and such action is commenced within two years after 
the date of the accident.

No Benefit To Bailee:

This insurance will not benefit any person or organization who may be caring for or 
handling your property for a fee.

BILLING & CANCELLATION TERMS

Payment:

If your initial premium payment for your first policy period is by check, draft, or any 
remittance other than cash, such payment is conditional upon the check, draft, or 
remittance being honored upon presentation. If such check, draft, or remittance is not 
honored, this policy shall be deemed void from its inception.

Conditional Reinstatement:

If we send a cancellation notice because the required premium was not paid in a 
timely manner, and you then tender payment by a remittance which is not honored 
upon presentation, your policy will terminate on the date and time shown on the 
cancellation notice and any notice we issue which waives the cancellation or 
reinstates coverage is void.

Transfer:

You may not transfer this policy to another person without our written consent. 
However, if you die, this policy will provide coverage until the end of the policy period 
for your legal representative while acting as such and for persons covered on the date 
of your death.

BILLING & CANCELLATION TERMS

Payment:

If your initial premium payment for your first policy period is by check, draft, or any 
remittance other than cash, such payment is conditional upon the check, draft, or 
remittance being honored upon presentation. If such check, draft, or remittance is not 
honored, this policy shall be deemed void from its inception.

Conditional Reinstatement:

If we send a cancellation notice because the required premium was not paid in a 
timely manner, and you then tender payment by a remittance which is not honored

upon presentation, your policy will terminate on the date and time shown on the 
cancellation notice and any notice we issue which waives the cancellation or 
reinstates coverage is void.

Transfer:

You may not transfer this policy to another person without our written consent. 
However, if you die, this policy will provide coverage until the end of the policy period 
for your legal representative while acting as such and for persons covered on the date 
of your death.

General Statement Of Coverage

If a premium is shown on the Policy Declarations for Automobile Liability Insurance, we will pay 
damages which an insured person is legally obligated to pay because of: 1. bodily injury 
sustained by any person, and 2. damage to, or destruction of, property. Under these coverages, 
your policy protects an insured person from liability for damages arising out of the ownership, 
maintenance, or use, loading or unloading, of an insured auto. We will not pay any punitive or 
exemplary damages, fines or penalties under this coverage. We will defend an insured person 
sued as a result of a covered accident. We will choose the counsel. We may settle any claim or 
suit if we believe it is proper.

Additional Payments We Will Make

When we defend an insured person under this Part, we will pay:

1.​ Up to $100 a day for the loss of wages or salary if we ask that person to attend hearings 
or trials.

2.​ Court costs for defense. 
3.​ Interest accruing on a judgment entered against you, but only on that part of a judgment

which does not exceed our limits of liability. 
4.​ Premiums on appeal bonds and on bonds to release attachments, but not in excess of

our limit of liability. 
5.​ The cost of any bail bonds required because of an accident, not to exceed $300 per

bond.

"adb697f5-a3f8-4d1b-aba9-5bd2b04dc227","A person making a claim must allow us to take signed and recorded statements, 
including sworn statements and examinations under oath, separately and apart from 
others, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may 
reasonably require.

Our Payment Of Loss:

Our limit of liability is the least of: 1) the actual cash value of the property or damaged 
part of the property at the time of loss, which may include a deduction for 
depreciation; 2) the cost to repair or replace the property or part to its physical 
condition at the time of loss using parts produced by or for the vehicle's 
manufacturer, or parts from other sources; or 3) the limit of liability shown on the 
Policy Declarations. Any applicable deductible amount is then subtracted.

Right To Appraisal:

Both you and we have a right to demand an appraisal of the loss. Each will appoint 
and pay a qualified appraiser. The two appraisers, or a judge of a court of record, will 
select an umpire. A written agreement by any two of these three persons will 
determine the amount of the loss.

Action Against Us:

No one may bring an action against us in any way related to the existence or amount 
of coverage, or the amount of loss for which coverage is sought, unless there is full 
compliance with all policy terms and such action is commenced within two years after 
the date of the accident.

No Benefit To Bailee:

This insurance will not benefit any person or organization who may be caring for or 
handling your property for a fee.

installments of $324.31. Each payment is due on the 15th day of each month. A late fee 
of $10.00 will apply for any missed or returned payment. If payment is not received 
within 10 days after the due date, coverage may lapse and cancellation procedures

which is not honored upon presentation, your policy will terminate on the date and 
time shown on the cancellation notice and any notice we issue which waives the

-----Part 2: General Provisions & Insuring Agreement

Insuring Agreement

This policy is a legal contract between you (the policyholder listed as Named Insured on the 
Policy Declarations) and us (Insurance Megacorp). A coverage applies only when a premium for 
it is shown on the Policy Declarations. If you pay the premiums when due and comply with the 
policy terms, we, relying on the information you have given us, agree to provide the coverages 
as described herein. You agree that it is your responsibility to review your Policy Declarations to 
confirm that the coverages and limits that you requested have actually been issued to you and 
are appropriate for your insurance needs. The terms of this policy impose joint obligations on 
persons defined as insured persons. This means that the responsibilities, acts and omissions of 
a person defined as an insured person will be binding upon other person(s) defined as insured 
person(s).

When And Where The Policy Applies

Your policy applies only during the policy period. During this time, it applies to covered losses to 
the auto, accidents, and occurrences within the United States, its territories or possessions, 
Canada, and between their ports.

Conformity To State Statutes

When the policy provisions are in conflict with the statutes of the state in which your auto(s) 
described on the Policy Declarations are principally garaged, the provisions are amended to

"b87636b0-e08b-4b5f-804d-868fdbc6b29b","If a premium is shown on the Policy Declarations for Automobile Liability Insurance, we 
will pay damages which an insured person is legally obligated to pay because of: 1. 
bodily injury sustained by any person, and 2. damage to, or destruction of, property. 
Under these coverages, your policy protects an insured person from liability for 
damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use, loading or unloading, of 
an insured auto. We will not pay any punitive or exemplary damages, fines or penalties 
under this coverage. We will defend an insured person sued as a result of a covered 
accident. We will choose the counsel. We may settle any claim or suit if we believe it is 
proper.

Additional Payments We Will Make

When we defend an insured person under this Part, we will pay:

1.​ Up to $100 a day for the loss of wages or salary if we ask that person to attend 
hearings or trials.

2.​ Court costs for defense. 
3.​ Interest accruing on a judgment entered against you, but only on that part of a

judgment which does not exceed our limits of liability. 
4.​ Premiums on appeal bonds and on bonds to release attachments, but not in

excess of our limit of liability. 
5.​ The cost of any bail bonds required because of an accident, not to exceed

$300 per bond.

Exclusions - What Is Not Covered Under Liability

We will not pay for any damages an insured person is legally obligated to pay because 
of:

●​ Intentional Injury: Bodily injury or property damage intended by, or reasonably 
expected to result from, the intentional or criminal acts or omissions of an

General Statement Of Coverage

If a premium is shown on the Policy Declarations for Automobile Liability Insurance, we will pay 
damages which an insured person is legally obligated to pay because of: 1. bodily injury 
sustained by any person, and 2. damage to, or destruction of, property. Under these coverages, 
your policy protects an insured person from liability for damages arising out of the ownership, 
maintenance, or use, loading or unloading, of an insured auto. We will not pay any punitive or 
exemplary damages, fines or penalties under this coverage. We will defend an insured person 
sued as a result of a covered accident. We will choose the counsel. We may settle any claim or 
suit if we believe it is proper.

Additional Payments We Will Make

When we defend an insured person under this Part, we will pay:

1.​ Up to $100 a day for the loss of wages or salary if we ask that person to attend hearings 
or trials.

2.​ Court costs for defense. 
3.​ Interest accruing on a judgment entered against you, but only on that part of a judgment

which does not exceed our limits of liability. 
4.​ Premiums on appeal bonds and on bonds to release attachments, but not in excess of

our limit of liability. 
5.​ The cost of any bail bonds required because of an accident, not to exceed $300 per

bond.

"c40d4d15-80c3-42f9-a22a-1584858dbea9","A person making a claim must allow us to take signed and recorded statements, 
including sworn statements and examinations under oath, separately and apart from 
others, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may 
reasonably require.

Our Payment Of Loss:

Our limit of liability is the least of: 1) the actual cash value of the property or damaged 
part of the property at the time of loss, which may include a deduction for 
depreciation; 2) the cost to repair or replace the property or part to its physical 
condition at the time of loss using parts produced by or for the vehicle's 
manufacturer, or parts from other sources; or 3) the limit of liability shown on the 
Policy Declarations. Any applicable deductible amount is then subtracted.

Right To Appraisal:

Both you and we have a right to demand an appraisal of the loss. Each will appoint 
and pay a qualified appraiser. The two appraisers, or a judge of a court of record, will 
select an umpire. A written agreement by any two of these three persons will 
determine the amount of the loss.

Action Against Us:

No one may bring an action against us in any way related to the existence or amount 
of coverage, or the amount of loss for which coverage is sought, unless there is full 
compliance with all policy terms and such action is commenced within two years after 
the date of the accident.

No Benefit To Bailee:

This insurance will not benefit any person or organization who may be caring for or 
handling your property for a fee.

"c899a6eb-b9a4-44ba-8e7b-db224bcf3957","A person making a claim must allow us to take signed and recorded statements, 
including sworn statements and examinations under oath, separately and apart from 
others, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may 
reasonably require.

Our Payment Of Loss:

Our limit of liability is the least of: 1) the actual cash value of the property or damaged 
part of the property at the time of loss, which may include a deduction for 
depreciation; 2) the cost to repair or replace the property or part to its physical 
condition at the time of loss using parts produced by or for the vehicle's 
manufacturer, or parts from other sources; or 3) the limit of liability shown on the 
Policy Declarations. Any applicable deductible amount is then subtracted.

Right To Appraisal:

Both you and we have a right to demand an appraisal of the loss. Each will appoint 
and pay a qualified appraiser. The two appraisers, or a judge of a court of record, will 
select an umpire. A written agreement by any two of these three persons will 
determine the amount of the loss.

Action Against Us:

No one may bring an action against us in any way related to the existence or amount 
of coverage, or the amount of loss for which coverage is sought, unless there is full 
compliance with all policy terms and such action is commenced within two years after 
the date of the accident.

No Benefit To Bailee:

This insurance will not benefit any person or organization who may be caring for or 
handling your property for a fee.

BILLING & CANCELLATION TERMS

Payment:

If your initial premium payment for your first policy period is by check, draft, or any 
remittance other than cash, such payment is conditional upon the check, draft, or 
remittance being honored upon presentation. If such check, draft, or remittance is not 
honored, this policy shall be deemed void from its inception.

Conditional Reinstatement:

If we send a cancellation notice because the required premium was not paid in a 
timely manner, and you then tender payment by a remittance which is not honored 
upon presentation, your policy will terminate on the date and time shown on the 
cancellation notice and any notice we issue which waives the cancellation or 
reinstates coverage is void.

Transfer:

You may not transfer this policy to another person without our written consent. 
However, if you die, this policy will provide coverage until the end of the policy period 
for your legal representative while acting as such and for persons covered on the date 
of your death.

BILLING & CANCELLATION TERMS

Payment:

If your initial premium payment for your first policy period is by check, draft, or any 
remittance other than cash, such payment is conditional upon the check, draft, or 
remittance being honored upon presentation. If such check, draft, or remittance is not 
honored, this policy shall be deemed void from its inception.

Conditional Reinstatement:

If we send a cancellation notice because the required premium was not paid in a 
timely manner, and you then tender payment by a remittance which is not honored

upon presentation, your policy will terminate on the date and time shown on the 
cancellation notice and any notice we issue which waives the cancellation or 
reinstates coverage is void.

Transfer:

You may not transfer this policy to another person without our written consent. 
However, if you die, this policy will provide coverage until the end of the policy period 
for your legal representative while acting as such and for persons covered on the date 
of your death.

General Statement Of Coverage

If a premium is shown on the Policy Declarations for Automobile Liability Insurance, we will pay 
damages which an insured person is legally obligated to pay because of: 1. bodily injury 
sustained by any person, and 2. damage to, or destruction of, property. Under these coverages, 
your policy protects an insured person from liability for damages arising out of the ownership, 
maintenance, or use, loading or unloading, of an insured auto. We will not pay any punitive or 
exemplary damages, fines or penalties under this coverage. We will defend an insured person 
sued as a result of a covered accident. We will choose the counsel. We may settle any claim or 
suit if we believe it is proper.

Additional Payments We Will Make

When we defend an insured person under this Part, we will pay:

1.​ Up to $100 a day for the loss of wages or salary if we ask that person to attend hearings 
or trials.

2.​ Court costs for defense. 
3.​ Interest accruing on a judgment entered against you, but only on that part of a judgment

which does not exceed our limits of liability. 
4.​ Premiums on appeal bonds and on bonds to release attachments, but not in excess of

our limit of liability. 
5.​ The cost of any bail bonds required because of an accident, not to exceed $300 per

bond.

BILLING & CANCELLATION TERMS

Payment:

If your initial premium payment for your first policy period is by check, draft, or any 
remittance other than cash, such payment is conditional upon the check, draft, or 
remittance being honored upon presentation. If such check, draft, or remittance is not

honored, this policy shall be deemed void from its inception.

Conditional Reinstatement:

If we send a cancellation notice because the required premium was not paid in a 
timely manner, and you then tender payment by a remittance which is not honored 
upon presentation, your policy will terminate on the date and time shown on the 
cancellation notice and any notice we issue which waives the cancellation or 
reinstates coverage is void.

Transfer:

You may not transfer this policy to another person without our written consent. 
However, if you die, this policy will provide coverage until the end of the policy period 
for your legal representative while acting as such and for persons covered on the date 
of your death.

General Statement Of Coverage

If a premium is shown on the Policy Declarations for Automobile Liability Insurance, we will pay 
damages which an insured person is legally obligated to pay because of: 1. bodily injury 
sustained by any person, and 2. damage to, or destruction of, property. Under these coverages, 
your policy protects an insured person from liability for damages arising out of the ownership, 
maintenance, or use, loading or unloading, of an insured auto. We will not pay any punitive or 
exemplary damages, fines or penalties under this coverage. We will defend an insured person 
sued as a result of a covered accident. We will choose the counsel. We may settle any claim or 
suit if we believe it is proper.

Additional Payments We Will Make

When we defend an insured person under this Part, we will pay:

1.​ Up to $100 a day for the loss of wages or salary if we ask that person to attend hearings 
or trials.

2.​ Court costs for defense. 
3.​ Interest accruing on a judgment entered against you, but only on that part of a judgment

which does not exceed our limits of liability. 
4.​ Premiums on appeal bonds and on bonds to release attachments, but not in excess of

our limit of liability. 
5.​ The cost of any bail bonds required because of an accident, not to exceed $300 per

bond.

If a premium is shown on the Policy Declarations for Automobile Medical Payments,

we will pay to or on behalf of an insured person reasonable expenses actually incurred 
for necessary medical treatment, medical services or medical products. Payment will 
be made only when bodily injury is caused by a motor vehicle accident. Medical 
treatment must begin within 90 days of the date of the accident and be rendered

"fbf4d7e7-4ee0-4142-9caf-65e72f858685","If a premium is shown on the Policy Declarations for Automobile Liability Insurance, we 
will pay damages which an insured person is legally obligated to pay because of: 1. 
bodily injury sustained by any person, and 2. damage to, or destruction of, property. 
Under these coverages, your policy protects an insured person from liability for 
damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use, loading or unloading, of 
an insured auto. We will not pay any punitive or exemplary damages, fines or penalties 
under this coverage. We will defend an insured person sued as a result of a covered 
accident. We will choose the counsel. We may settle any claim or suit if we believe it is 
proper.

Additional Payments We Will Make

When we defend an insured person under this Part, we will pay:

1.​ Up to $100 a day for the loss of wages or salary if we ask that person to attend 
hearings or trials.

2.​ Court costs for defense. 
3.​ Interest accruing on a judgment entered against you, but only on that part of a

judgment which does not exceed our limits of liability. 
4.​ Premiums on appeal bonds and on bonds to release attachments, but not in

excess of our limit of liability. 
5.​ The cost of any bail bonds required because of an accident, not to exceed

$300 per bond.

Exclusions - What Is Not Covered Under Liability

We will not pay for any damages an insured person is legally obligated to pay because 
of:

●​ Intentional Injury: Bodily injury or property damage intended by, or reasonably 
expected to result from, the intentional or criminal acts or omissions of an
